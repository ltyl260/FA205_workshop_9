## Workshop 9: Live Video

Make an experimental 'smart mirror' using live video capture.
Include manipulations at the level of the pixel, **duck camera!!!**
Important things to include were access to webcam and my duck clsss
>let webcam;
>let ducks = [];

I generated a tonne of ducks and filled them with colours from the camera for a cool effect.
> for (x = 0; x < 20; x++){
>  ducks[x] = new Duck(random(width),random(height),random(5));
>}
